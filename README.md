# Shop3

Shop3 is a proof-of-concept for **agent-native commerce via the x402 micropayment protocol**. The thesis: AI agents operating autonomously need a way to pay for services machine-to-machine — no OAuth, no credit cards, no human in the loop. x402 is that protocol. An agent hits an endpoint, receives HTTP `402 Payment Required`, pays in USDC on-chain, proves it with a transaction hash, and gets access.

Shop3 demonstrates the full loop: a Claude-powered agent receives a natural-language shopping prompt, pays per search via the x402 gateway, evaluates results, purchases the best option, and publishes a cryptographically-linked receipt — all autonomously.

```
User prompt → agent searches (pays 402) → evaluates → pays for product → logs → publishes receipt
```

## Features

### 🧠 Agent Intelligence
- **Autonomous Agentic Loop**: Powered by the **Anthropic Claude API**, the agent runs a continuous "think-act" loop with a configurable turn cap to prevent runaway execution. It uses native tool-calling to independently decide when to search, evaluate products, execute payments, or log results — with no human in the loop after the initial prompt.
- **Strategic Evaluation**: Unlike simple scripts, the agent evaluates search results against user constraints (budget, reputation, and service type) before deciding to purchase.
- **Structured Search**: The agent can request typed JSON from the x402 bridge — specifying fields like `name`, `price`, `url`, `rating` — instead of re-parsing raw descriptions.
- **Purchase Memory**: The agent checks its own ClickHouse purchase history before buying to avoid duplicates across runs.
- **Web Search via Nimble**: Powered by the **Nimble API** — handles CAPTCHAs, bot detection, and proxy rotation automatically. The agent never holds a Nimble API key; it pays per search through the x402 bridge.

### 💸 Web3 Payments & Safety
- **x402 Micropayment Protocol**: The core demo. The agent hits the Nimble→x402 bridge, receives `402 Payment Required`, pays 0.001 USDC on-chain, and retries with `x-payment-proof: <txHash>`. Machine-to-machine payments without API keys or accounts.
- **Circle Programmable Wallets**: Uses **Circle's Developer-Controlled Wallets** on ARC-TESTNET. The agent holds its own USDC balance and signs transactions server-side via Circle's API — no private key management required.
- **Spend Guard**: A configurable daily spending limit (default $10, set via `MAX_DAILY_USD`). Backed by ClickHouse so it persists across restarts. Serialised with a process-level mutex to prevent race conditions under concurrent payments.
- **Wallet Balance Check**: Verifies on-chain USDC balance before submitting a payment. Fails fast with a clear error rather than letting the Circle API reject mid-flight.
- **Auto-Retry with Backoff**: Circle transaction submissions retry once with a 5s delay and an idempotency key — prevents double-spend and recovers from transient RPC hiccups.
- **Max Turns Guard**: The agentic loop is capped at `MAX_AGENT_TURNS` (default 10) iterations. If Claude loops without completing, the run aborts instead of burning API credits indefinitely.
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Pass `--dry-run` to simulate a full agent run — search and evaluate without executing any payment or publishing any receipt.

### 📊 Transparency & Observability
- **Purchase Audit Log**: Every transaction is recorded in **ClickHouse Cloud** with query, product, price, tx hash, tools invoked, latency, and source domain — queryable with real aggregations.
- **Analytics CLI**: `npm run history:stats` runs ClickHouse aggregations across the purchase log — top source domains, tools-per-purchase distribution, 7-day spend summary.
- **Verified Receipts (cited.md)**: Automatically publishes public markdown receipts via the **Senso platform**, citeable by search engines and other AI agents.
- **Lapdog + Datadog**: In development, `npm run lapdog` streams every Claude API call, token count, cost, cache hit rate, and payment span to a live local dashboard at lapdog.datadoghq.com — no account required. In production the same spans forward to **Datadog**.
- **GEO Monitoring**: Monitors how major LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) perceive and cite Shop3 across the web via the Senso platform.
- **Webhook Notifications**: Set `WEBHOOK_URL` to receive a POST on every completed (or dry-run) purchase.
- **Scheduled Runs**: `npm run schedule` runs a configurable prompt list on a repeat interval.
- **Payment Replay Protection**: The x402 bridge tracks used transaction hashes — a proof cannot be reused to unlock multiple searches.

## Quick start

> **The x402 bridge must be running before the agent.** Start it first.

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Required env vars:

```bash
# Agent
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=          # Claude API

# x402 bridge (server.js)
NIMBLE_API_KEY=             # Nimble web search — used by the bridge, not the agent
SEARCH_MIDDLEWARE_URL=http://localhost:3000/search
SEARCH_PAYMENT_ADDRESS=     # Address the bridge charges payments to
SEARCH_PAYMENT_AMOUNT=0.001

# Circle wallet (agent payments)
CIRCLE_API_KEY=
CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET=
CIRCLE_WALLET_ADDRESS=
CIRCLE_WALLET_ID=
CIRCLE_NETWORK=ARC-TESTNET
USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000

# ClickHouse
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=            # https://your-host:8443
CLICKHOUSE_USER=
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=

# Senso (receipts)
SENSO_API_KEY=
```

4. Start the Nimble→x402 bridge:

```bash
npm run start:server
```

5. Run the agent (in a separate terminal):

```bash
node index.js "Find me the best web data API under $10 and buy it"
```

6. View purchase history:

```bash
npm run history           # last 10 purchases
npm run history:stats     # ClickHouse analytics — domains, tools, spend summary
```

7. (Optional) Run with **lapdog** for a live LLM observability dashboard:

```bash
pip install ddapm-test-agent   # one-time
npm run lapdog                 # dashboard at lapdog.datadoghq.com
```

8. (Optional) Dry-run — search and evaluate without spending:

```bash
npm run dry-run "Find me a $5 weather API"
```

The agent never holds a Nimble API key. It pays 0.001 USDC per search through the x402 bridge — the bridge verifies the on-chain payment (recipient, amount, chain, replay) before forwarding the query to Nimble.

## Infrastructure

### Runtime

Node.js (CommonJS), single-process. The agent, payment, logging, and publishing all run in the same process. The bridge (`server.js`) runs as a separate process. The core is a `while(true)` agentic loop capped at `MAX_AGENT_TURNS`.

### Agent tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search_web` | Calls the x402 bridge, pays 402 if needed, returns results (optionally structured) |
| `pay_for_purchase` | Submits USDC transfer via Circle, polls for confirmation |
| `log_to_database` | Inserts purchase row to ClickHouse with analytics fields |
| `publish_receipt` | Publishes markdown receipt to cited.md via Senso |
| `check_purchase_history` | Queries ClickHouse to avoid duplicate purchases |

### Nimble→x402 Bridge (`server.js`)

Local Express server on `localhost:3000`. Every `/search` request:
1. Returns `402` if `x-payment-proof` header is missing
2. Validates the tx hash — state, recipient, amount ≥ `SEARCH_PAYMENT_AMOUNT`, correct chain
3. Checks the hash hasn't been used before (replay protection)
4. Forwards the query to Nimble, optionally runs Claude Haiku for structured field extraction
5. Returns results

### Payment (`payment.js`)

- **Circle Programmable Wallets** — `createTransaction` submits USDC transfer, polls `getTransaction` until `CONFIRMED`
- **Spend lock** — promise-chained mutex serialises concurrent payments so the ClickHouse check+record is atomic
- **Retry** — one auto-retry with 5s backoff and idempotency key on submission failures
- **Balance check** — verifies USDC balance before submitting

### Database (`memory.js`)

ClickHouse Cloud, MergeTree engine, auto-created on first write.

**`agent_purchases`**

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp` | DateTime | When the purchase happened |
| `query` | String | Original user prompt |
| `selected_result` | String | What was purchased |
| `price` | String | Price string as quoted |
| `price_usd` | Float32 | Parsed numeric price |
| `tx_hash` | String | On-chain transaction hash |
| `source_url` | String | Product URL |
| `nimble_results_count` | UInt32 | How many search results were evaluated |
| `total_latency_ms` | UInt64 | End-to-end agent run time |
| `tools_invoked` | Array(String) | Ordered list of tools called |

**`agent_spend`**

Tracks daily USDC spend. Summed at payment time to enforce `MAX_DAILY_USD`.

### External Services

| Service | Purpose | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic API | Claude LLM (agent brain) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Nimble API | Web search (bridge-side only) | `NIMBLE_API_KEY` |
| Circle Programmable Wallets | USDC payments on ARC-TESTNET | `CIRCLE_API_KEY` + `CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET` |
| ARC-TESTNET | L2 blockchain (testnet) | — |
| ClickHouse Cloud | Purchase audit log + analytics | `CLICKHOUSE_*` |
| Senso / cited.md | Receipt publishing + GEO monitoring | `SENSO_API_KEY` |
| Lapdog / Datadog | Local dev dashboard + production APM | `DD_API_KEY` (production only) |

## Observability (Lapdog + Datadog)

Shop3 is instrumented via `dd-trace`. Every agent run, tool call, payment, and on-chain confirmation produces a span on `localhost:8126`. In development **[Lapdog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/lapdog/)** captures these locally — no account needed. In production the same spans forward to **Datadog**.

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shop3.agent.run.started` | count | Agent invocation started |
| `shop3.agent.run.completed` | count | Agent completed full flow |
| `shop3.agent.run.duration_ms` | distribution | End-to-end agent run time |

| `shop3.search.results_count` | gauge | Search results returned |
| `shop3.payment.tx.submitted` | count | Circle tx submitted |
| `shop3.payment.tx.confirmed` | count | Circle tx confirmed on-chain |
| `shop3.payment.tx.retried` | count | Auto-retry fired |
| `shop3.payment.tx.error` | count | Payment failed (tag: `reason`) |
| `shop3.payment.amount_usd` | gauge | USD amount per transaction |
| `shop3.payment.daily_spend_usd` | gauge | Running daily spend total |
| `shop3.payment.confirmation_ms` | distribution | Time to on-chain confirmation |
| `shop3.geo.mention_score` | gauge | Brand mention rate per LLM model |
| `shop3.geo.citation_count` | gauge | cited.md citations per model |

### Setup

**Development (Lapdog — no account required):**
```bash
pip install ddapm-test-agent
npm run lapdog        # agent with live dashboard at lapdog.datadoghq.com
npm run lapdog:server # or the x402 bridge
```

**Production (Datadog):**
```bash
DD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DD_AGENT_HOST=localhost   # default
DD_AGENT_PORT=8126        # default
```

## Spend Guard

The $10/day limit is enforced by a ClickHouse-backed ledger before each Circle transaction is submitted. Every payment records a row to `agent_spend`; the pre-flight check sums today's rows and rejects the payment if adding the new amount would exceed the cap. A process-level mutex serialises concurrent payments so two simultaneous purchases cannot both slip past the cap.

This is a server-side JS guard — it cannot be bypassed by an external attacker, but could be bypassed by modifying the agent source. For the demo it is the authoritative mechanism; a production deployment could layer on a Circle wallet policy for custodian-level enforcement.

## Agent Wallet

The agent's Circle wallet on ARC-TESTNET:

```
0x490776E3c67986f1A2385413e52FAeE1772A729A
```

Fund with testnet USDC at the Circle developer console to enable autonomous payments.
